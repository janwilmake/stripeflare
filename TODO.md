Stripeflare v0.0.32 (BREAKING)

- Bugfixes
- Added standard headers `X-Balance` and `X-Paymentlink`
- You can now charge by just passing `X-Price` header to the response!
- Improved `create-stripeflare` template
- Security enhancements

NB: If you used stripeflare before, be aware that everything past v0.0.26 resets old data by using new DO naming strategy
