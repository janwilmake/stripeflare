# Fix Stripeflare

Stripeflare v0.0.26

- Fixed errors occuring when you have several webhooks set up
- Added standard headers `X-Balance` and `X-Paymentlink`
- You can now charge by just passing `X-Price`
-

Then, create a Stripeflare for the images. Then, make a video of that entire process and aim to get it to under 5 minutes.
