# Fix Stripeflare

- ✅ Check all emails I am getting from stripe and what can be done about this webhook failure stuff
- ✅ Re-enable webhooks
- ✅ Add `x-balance` and `x-paymentlink`
- ✅ Add `x-price` as forced charge so charge function isn't needed per se
- ✅ Document all of this

Then, create a Stripeflare for the images. Then, make a video of that entire process and aim to get it to under 5 minutes.
