Stripeflare is middleware that adds Stripe Payments to a Cloudflare Worker and have users keep track of a balance in your own database, without requiring third-party authentication (Just Stripe Payment)! Let me know your thoughts in [this thread](https://x.com/janwilmake/status/1924404433317675347) and check [the demo](https://x.com/janwilmake/status/1924766605143142683)

**‚ö°Ô∏è Lightning Fast** | **üîë ACID Compliant** | **‚òÅÔ∏è Cloudflare Optimised** | **üç¨ Minimal Setup**

# Automatic Installation.

```sh
npx create-stripeflare
```

See [create-stripeflare](https://github.com/janwilmake/create-stripeflare) for more detailed instructions.

# Manual Installation

First install the package (which also installs [DORM](https://github.com/janwilmake/dorm))

```sh
npm i stripeflare
```

The easiest way to install stripeflare **for existing projects**, is to use `withStripeflare` which wraps your entire `ExportedHandler`:

## `main.ts`

```ts
import { withStripeflare, StripeUser, DORM } from "stripeflare";
export { DORM };

export default {
  // StripeUser can be extended
  fetch: withStripeflare<StripeUser>(
    async (request, env, ctx) => {
      // ctx.user, ctx.client are now available
      const { user, registered } = ctx;

      if (request.url.endsWith("/charge")) {
        if (user.balance < 1) {
          return new Response("Payment Required", { status: 402 });
        }
        return new Response(JSON.stringify(result), {
          headers: {
            // Charges one cent
            "X-Price": "1",
          },
        });
      }

      return new Response(`Hello ${user.name || "Anonymous"}`);
    },
    {
      // customMigrations: optional way to overwrite default user table with an extension to your database
      // version: "1" // resets data
    },
  ),
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

`wrangler.json|toml`

The following adds DORM durable object to your Cloudflare Bindings, which stripeflare uses to allow for lightning-fast user balance charges.

```json
{
  "name": "stripeflare-example",
  "compatibility_date": "2025-06-06",
  "main": "main.ts",
  "durable_objects": {
    "bindings": [{ "name": "DORM_NAMESPACE", "class_name": "DORM" }]
  },
  "migrations": [{ "tag": "v1", "new_sqlite_classes": ["DORM"] }]
}
```

For TOML:

```toml

name = "stripeflare-example"
main = "main.ts"
compatibility_date = "2025-06-06"

[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "DORM_NAMESPACE"
class_name = "DORM"

[[migrations]]
tag = "v1"
new_sqlite_classes = ["DORM"]
```

`.dev.vars`

```env
# Create a Stripe account, navigate to https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys and collect `STRIPE_SECRET` and `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
STRIPE_SECRET=
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
# Create a webhook at https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks/create. Endpoint URL: https://yourdomain.com/stripe-webhook and sollect `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET=
# Create a payment link at https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links and set this as `STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK`
STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK=
# Put a 32 character+ secret here to sign your secrets
DB_SECRET=
```

## Usage

`withStripeflare` passes the follwoing to your `fetch` handler:

- `ctx.charge(amount, allowNegativeBalance)` charges the user
- `ctx.user` has a user object with or without details
- `ctx.client` contains your db client

In other handlers (schedules, queue, etc) you can use the `chargeUser` utility function to easily charge a user given their access_token:

```ts
const chargeUser = async (
  env: Env,
  ctx: ExecutionContext,
  user_access_token: string,
  migrations: any | undefined,
  version: string | undefined,
  amountCent: number,
  allowNegativeBalance: boolean,
) => Promise<{ charged: boolean; message: string }>;
```

In your static files you can also access these:

- `GET /me` returns `{paymentLink,client_reference_id, balance, name, email, card_fingerprint, verified_email }` which can be useful to show these details fast. Requires cookie!
- `POST /rotate-token` (to rotate the token, instable, may be removed in future version)
- `/db/*` (to perform direct queries to your databases) - for DORM integration with outerbase, see DORM Docs

Besides that, stripeflare standardises and uses the following response headers:

- You can pass `X-Price` to charge users automatically (amount in cents)
- Stripeflare passes `X-PaymentLink` with the paymentlink for the user
- Stripeflare passes `X-Balance` with the balance of the current user in cents

# About

## Features

- **Performant**: Creates a DB for each user while also mirroring it into an aggregate db (powered by [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) and [DORM](https://getdorm.com)), resulting in lightning-fast worker requests with user-balance.
- **Flexible**: Leverages [`?client_reference_id`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-client_reference_id) ensure connection to the user session whilst using any [Stripe Payment Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links).
- **Extensible**: Hooks into your own DO-based database so you can extend it however you like.
- **Login by Payment**: Users can access their previous balance from any device as long as they use the same Stripe Payment method (only supports payment methods `card` and `link`, see [ADR](ADR.md))

## When can you use this?

1. You want to use Cloudflare Workers for your app, with [DORM](https://github.com/janwilmake/dorm) as your database with segmentation on the user-level with one aggregate-db
2. You are VERY concerned with the performance of charging users. A user should be able to be charged within ¬±20ms.
3. You can use the source code as a starting point, giving you a virtual wallet system for your DORM-database. You don't need to use it as a dependency if you need additional logic and enhanced security.

## Good to know

- When you care a lot about multiple layers of security, don't use this. Currently, access_tokens are stored in the database as-is without encryption, which could expose them if other layers of security are compromised.
- When you want more production-ready things, don't use this. May still get breaking changes. This is still a research-project with limitations. See [ADR](ADR.md) for details.
- https://github.com/janwilmake/dorm is a dependency. When you want to interact with the same database to charge a user, ensure to use the returned `userClient` from the middleware (if available) or create a client yourself. The DB name access_token, the mirrorName should be "aggregate"
- we have some well-thoguht-out logic in the stripe webhook, allowing login-by-payment; read more here: https://www.lmpify.com/httpsrawgithubus-20o3gj0
- learn how to explore the data with outerbase here: https://www.lmpify.com/how-does-stripeflare-iqt4li0
- It is a massive improvement upon [Cloudflare Sponsorware](https://github.com/janwilmake/cloudflare-sponsorware) which I made before as it dramatically reduces complexity while improving upon UX and DX.
